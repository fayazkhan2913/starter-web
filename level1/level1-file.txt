Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.

This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men.
