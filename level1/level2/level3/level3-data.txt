My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. When they come... they come at what you love. You can act like a man! I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here.

What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? It's not personal. It's business. Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family.

I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry.
