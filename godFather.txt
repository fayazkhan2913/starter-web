Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. It's not personal. It's business. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!

Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive. Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!

Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. What's wrong with being a lawyer? Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful?
